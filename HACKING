Coding Standards
================

Please try and stick to the GNU coding standards.  A lot of hard work
went into making Check compatible with the standards, and would be
nice if that work didn't erode.  I decided on the standards because
they work well for a lot of programs much bigger than Check.  Ok,
since you're wondering, the advantages of sticking to the standards
are three-fold:

  1) consistent style within the project

  2) being familiar with the standards lets you work on lots of
     different GNU standards-compliant projects pretty easily

  3) it reduces the number of decisions that must be made

Release Process
===============

To create a release one will need to be a member of the libcheck organization
on GitHub. If you are not a member, a current member can add you
by going to:
   https://github.com/orgs/libcheck/people
and submitting an invite.

1) To create a release, start in a configured in-place
checkout of the Check project:

$ git clone https://github.com/libcheck/check.git
$ cd check

2) Determine the version of Check to release, and update
the configure.ac script:

AC_INIT([Check], [0.10.1], [check-devel at lists dot sourceforge dot net])
CHECK_MAJOR_VERSION=0
CHECK_MINOR_VERSION=10
CHECK_MICRO_VERSION=1

(Remember to update both the AC_INIT line and each of the CHECK_*_VERSION fields).

3) Update the header in the NEWS file to mention the release:

Sun Aug 2, 2015: Released Check 0.10.1
  2015-08-02 19:21:14 +0000
  based on hash f399542eeceb97703bca496b68bb39044e8baa01

4) Update index.html mentioning the release. Look for the following:
<!-- Update this section during a release -->

5) Attempt to build the release locally

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make distcheck

If this passes, a tarball with the current release number will be in the current
directory. Make not of this, as it will be uploaded to GitHub later.

6) Commit the changes to configure.ac, NEWS, and index.html to the Check project's
master branch, with the commit message:
"Update for release"

7) Log On to GitHub and navigate to:

https://github.com/libcheck/check/releases

Click "Draft a New Release".

Enter the release version to the Tag Version box, and enter the
git hash into the Target selector.

Fill in the Release Title field.

Describe the release with something similar to the following:
=====
<some sentence about the release, e.g. "This is a bug fix release.">
Please test it out and report any problems you might have.

Changes:
<paste contents of NEWS here for the release>
=====

Attach the tarball for the release, then publish the release.

8) Use the following template to announce the release via email:
=====
Subject: check-X.Y.Z released
Hi,

<some sentence about the release, e.g. "This is a bug fix release."> 
Please test it out and report any problems you might have.

https://github.com/libcheck/check/releases

Thanks,
`whoami`

<paste contents of NEWS for the release here>
=====

9) Update the development header in the NEWS file and commit the result.

10) Push updated website (see section below)

Congratulations, you are done!


Update website
==============

The Check website is automatically hosted from the contents of
the gh-pages branch in the Check git repository. To update
the website, merge the contents of the master branch into
the gh-pages branch.
